First you need to run data/fetch_data.py to generate the 300 repeats of Shakespeare book (big file). Then you can compile and run main_base.cpp by passing an integer argument which is the number of threads to be used. The script repeat.py repeats this process 100 times using 1 to 100 threads. The results are saved in time.txt and graphic.py generates the final image calle graphic.png.
